This is a repo for the specific functionality of the TP Link TL-WR902AC router.

Once you have configured the router with OpenWRT using - (https://github.com/thomasMEBaker/Relieve_OpenWRT/TL-WR902AC-OpenWRT.mp4)

You then need to go to System -> Flash Firmware then restore the firmware from the file on the repo. This will configure the router with a LAN and WAN network and firewall settings etc.
